      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
        Visit RateBeer.com's API page at 
        <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/json/ratebeer-api.asp">http://www.ratebeer.com/json/ratebeer-api.asp</a> 
        and follow the instructions provided.

  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">Can I use the plugin without a RateBeer.com API Key?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
        No. All of the data calls require a RateBeer API key.

  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">My RateBeer.com API Key request is taking too long. Can you help me?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
        No. The plugin author doesn't work for RateBeer.com, so I can't help speed up your RateBeer.com API request. 
        You can join the RateBeer.com API Google Group to inquire about the status.

  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">Can I hide the RateBeer branding ("Data Source: RateBeer")?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
        No. You cannot hide the RateBeer branding. 
        You are bound to RateBeer's API terms and conditions. Refer to the API Agreement section titled 'Branding' for clarification.

  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">How do I update incorrect data?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
        If a beer, brewer, or place data (content) is incorrect. Please log into RateBeer.com and submit the data change requests using
        the RateBeer.com web site.

  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">How does the cache work?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
          Each call to the RateBeer.com API stores the response as a file in the /cache/ folder. Then
          when another call is made to the same API function using the same parameters, the /cache/ 
          folder is checked to see if there's an already stored data file created within the specified
          cache time (default 24 hours). If a file is found (and it was created within the specified
          cache time), then the file is opened, read, and then displayed to the page. If a file
          was not found or the created time exceeded the cache time, then a call is made to RateBeer.com's
          web servers via their API and that response is stored in the /cache/ folder.
      </div>
   </div>

  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">How do I clear my cache?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
          There is a 'Delete Cache' button on the plugin's settings page.
      </div>
   </div>
          
  <h3 class="rb-toggleHeader"><a href="#">Why are different fields returned for different tags?</a></h3>
  <div style="display: block;" class="rb-toggleContainer">
      <div class="rb-toggleBlock">
          The fields returned for each API call might be different. For example, beer style is 
          not returned on some calls but may be returned on another call. 
          If you'd like to see more fields added to RateBeer's API calls, then you can 
          request RateBeer to modify their API to accommodate your request.
          Please post a note in the support forum, if RateBeer developers add the new field so I 
          can update the documentation and code.
